# VBA and Wall Street - Together at Last
### Background
In this project I had to use VBA scripting to analyze real stock market data.

This script
- loops through each year of stock data and returns the total volume each stock had over that year, with their proper ticker symbols
- calculates yearly change from the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year
- conditionally formats yearly changes based on whether or not the changes were positive or negative
- displays the greatest percent increase, greatest percent decrease and greatest total volume for any given year, with their proper ticker symbols
